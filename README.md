### Surface Plane 

#### Colour Scheme
Colour scheme for the website was designed to be subtle with accents of Lime Green to complement the Budgie theme.
* Body: --defaultWhite: #f5f5f5;
* Text: Lime Green #beee3a;, White #fff, Black #000000. Lime Green colour selected to match feathers of Budgie bird. 
* Navbar: White: #fff
* Footer: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);

#### Imagery

* Budgie bird logo: Immediately alerts the user to the theme of the app.  
* Body: Other images of people profiles to show the review section of the homepage.

#### Iconography 
* About page: use of fontawsome icons for LinkedIn and Github on the contact buttons leave the user in no doubt where to navigate to.
* Mobile: on small screen form factors the burger menu has been given extra bolder detail so that the user can easily use it to access the other parts of the site.

#### Typography
* font-family: 'Courgette', sans-serif; imported from Google Fonts used throughout.


## Deployment

#### GitHub Pages - Cloud Hosting

I decided to get the app hosted early in the development cycle before a lot of the code was produced.

The steps taken to host the Budgie app live were:

* Navigating to the GitHub Repository page.
* Selecting the 'Settings' Tab.
* Scroll Down to the GitHub Pages Heading on the left of the screen.
* Select 'Master/Main Branch' as the source and root folder.
* Click the Save button.
* Click on the link to go to the live deployed page (this may take a few moments while the page is built).
