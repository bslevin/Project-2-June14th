## Deployment

#### GitHub Pages - Cloud Hosting

I decided to get the app hosted early in the development cycle before a lot of the code was produced.

The steps taken to host the Budgie app live were:

* Navigating to the GitHub Repository page.
* Selecting the 'Settings' Tab.
* Scroll Down to the GitHub Pages Heading on the left of the screen.
* Select 'Master/Main Branch' as the source and root folder.
* Click the Save button.
* Click on the link to go to the live deployed page (this may take a few moments while the page is built).
